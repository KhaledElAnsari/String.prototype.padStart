## String.prototype.padStart

This is a polyfill for the [padStart](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart) prototype from the ECMAScript 8

## Why Another One?

Because of the already writtern polyfills are too complicated and I wanted something simpler and doesn't relys on other new prototypes!.

## Usage
You can install it with npm
```
npm install --save string.padstart
```

Or just [download it manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhaledElAnsari/String.prototype.padStart/master/index.js) and add it to your project
